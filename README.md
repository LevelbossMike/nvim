## Window management + shortcuts for MacOS

- Use yabai for tiling window management
- Use skhd for shortcuts
- Use karabiner elements for remapping the hyper key

## Karabiner Elements

- The `hyper`-key mimics command + option + ctrl + shift. This is nice because
  no key-combination has been set with all modifier keys pressed together. This
  makes window management with Yabai easy to shortcut.
- To get the `hyper`-key - you need to install the "Change caps_lock key"
  extension. It will send the `hyper`-key when caps_lock is pressed but treat it
  as `esc` when pressed alone without another key
